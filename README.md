This project is a basic snake game implemented using JavaFX and Scene Builder. Enjoy the nostalgia of controlling a snake as it moves around the game board, eating food to grow longer while avoiding collisions with itself and the walls.

### Features:
- **Classic Gameplay:** Experience the classic gameplay of controlling a snake in a grid-based environment.
- **User Controls:** Control the movement of the snake using arrow keys or designated buttons in the user interface.
- **Scoring System:** Keep track of your score as the snake eats food and grows longer.
- **Game Over Detection:** Detect collisions with the snake's body or the game board's boundaries to end the game.
- **Restart Option:** Restart the game with the click of a button after the game ends.
